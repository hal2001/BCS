Description:              'Multidimensional Scaling is performed on a subset of the data "cars93" from
                           package "MASS". First, the subset is selected, then the MDS model is fitted
                           using Euclidean distance. The result is shown in a plot.'

Keywords:                 'multidimensional, MASS, MDS, euclidean distance, plot'
