Description:               'Example of Linear Discriminant analysis using the data
                            "spanish" and "spanishMeta" from package "LanguageR". The data is randomly
                            split into a training and test set beforehand. The observations and discrimiation
                            borders are shown in a plot and the prediction error is calculated.'
