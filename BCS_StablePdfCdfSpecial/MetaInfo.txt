Description:                   'The code below plots the pdfs and cdfs for three special cases
                                of the stable distribution for which the pdf and cdf have a
                                closed form expression. The special cases are the normal,
                                Cauchy and Levy distribution. Normal distributions have a
                                kurtosis of three and zero skewness. The Cauchy distribution
                                is symmetric around its mean but has thicker tails than the
                                normal distribution. Random variables with a Levy distribution
                                have a skewness which tends to one. Only variables which are
                                above the mean will be observed.'
