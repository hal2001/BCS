Description:            'The F-distribution, also called the Fisher-Snedecor
                         distribution, is the ratio of two independent chisquared
                         distributed random variables. The degrees of freedom of the
                         numerator and denominatoer determine how the pdf and cdf
                         behave. If n=1 the pdf is monotonically decreasing and the
                         ordinate is the asymptote. For n=2 the pdf intersects the
                         ordinate at 1 and monotically decreases. Only if n>=3 the pdf
                         is assymetrically bell shaped.'
