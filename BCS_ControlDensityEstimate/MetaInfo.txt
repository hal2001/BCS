Description:              'The rpanel package employs different graphical user interface (GUI) controls
                           to enable the immediate communication with the graphical output and provides
                           dynamic graphics. In this example a control panel with a slider and a double
                           button is created to control the bandwidth of a density plot.'

Keywords:                 'rpanel, tcltk, slider, double, button, plot, density, bandwidth, three dimensional plot'
