Published in: 'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description: 'QQ plots compare empirical quantiles of a distribution with
              theoretical quantiles of the standard normal distribution. If
              the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution tend to infinity,
              the QQ plot is a 45 degree line. Quantiles of the
              t-distribution and normal distribution are identical.
              The t-distribution converges to the normal distribution in
              infinite samples.'
