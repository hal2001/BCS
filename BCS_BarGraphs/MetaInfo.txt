Description:           'Bar diagram and plot of relative frequencies of the R data subset
                       "chickwts$feed". It is an efficient way of plotting the frequencies of
                        discreet variables, particularly useful to illustrate the behaviour (variation)
                        over time.'
  
Keywords:              'data visualization, distribution, graphical representation, plot, visualization'
