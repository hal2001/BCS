Description:             'The code produces an inteactive plot for the illustration of
                          the Newton-Raphson method. In the example the univariate
                          function f(x) = x^2 - 4 is optimized. An optimum is found, if
                          the first derivative of the function at this point is equal
                          to zero. Therefore the method looks for the root of the
                          first derivative.'
