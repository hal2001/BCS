Description:             'The normal distribution is very often applied in statisitics.
                          It is a stable distribution, which is symmetric around its
                          mean. The standard normal distribution has an expectaion of
                          zero and variance equals one. Higher variance leads to flatter
                          pdfs and cdfs.'
