Description: 'A stable distribution can be linearly transformed and stays
              a stable distribtuion. The location and scale parameter for
              the plots are identical. Only the skewness and kurtosis
              varies among the graphs. If beta, the skewness parameter, is
              smaller than zero, the distribuion is skewed to the left.
              Therefore smaller values of the rv are more likely. If beta is
              greater than zero, the opposite is true. Alpha determines the
              kurtosis of the distribution. Higher values lead
              to thicker tails and therefore values far from the mean
              are more likely.'
